	<p><b>Saturday 15th October, 1pm to 6pm at <a href="../venue.html">Broad Oak Sports and Social Club</a></b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">A Whistle-stop Tour of jQuery and Node.js</b></p>
	<p><b> Jeffrey Best</b><p>
	<p>Jeffrey is Analyst/Programmer at Travel Places, a professional sports group travel agency, based in Worthing, associated with
       	American Express Global Business Travel, who provide travel services to professional sports organisations such as F1 race teams,
       	TeamGB, the Paralympics Association, the Scout Association, Americas Cup and many others. Travel Places also manages sports and
       	other subject-related tours for a growing number of schools and clubs.</p> 
	<p>Jeffrey supports (and extends) a legacy, bespoke Sales, Accounting and Reporting system while at the same time specifying and
       	managing the projects for a team of four other developers working on re-engineering the system to use a flexible service-oriented
       	architecture using Enterprise Integration Patterns.</p>
	<p>They have started to use jQuery widely and they have been exploring whether Node.js is a suitable technology to deploy for
       	services to slot into process chains to support generic functionality tailored to the specific short-term requirements of a particular
       	client or event.</p>
	<p> This talk was created as part of Jeffrey's programme to develop in-house training resources.</p>
