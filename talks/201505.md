	<h1>May 2015 Meet</h1>
	<p><b>Saturday 16th May, 1pm to 6pm at <a href="../venue.html">Broad Oak Social Club</a></b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">Cryptography and Linux</b><b> - Gareth Owen</b></p>
	<p>Gareth teaches and undertakes research into Cryptography and Digital Forensics at the
	<a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/">University of Portsmouth</a>. Some of you will remember his gripping talk about the dark web. He is
	a speaker who is well worth hearing. Here is his abstract:</p>
	<p> This talk is divided into two parts. In the first part we'll talk about how modern ciphers work and how we use them to create
	something that's secure. In the second part of the talk we'll discuss how to do cryptography on Linux from encrypting your hard disk
	to sending an encrypted e-mail. There are lots of ways to do this and I'll aim to cover the key points so that you can choose the best
	approach that suits you - if you can, bring your laptop with your favourite flavour of Linux because there'll be a opportunity to have
	a go.</p>
	<p>I'm also happy to do a general cryptography Q&amp;A at the end of the talk and answer anything that I have expertise in - so please
	bring any questions. Perhaps you're wondering whether Truecrypt is still secure despite their vanishing act or how the Police tackle
	encrypted data?<p>
	<p>You can download the slides from the talk <a href="201505.pdf">here</a>.</p>
