	<p><b>Ross Cruickshank</b></p>
	<p>This month we have a talk on Node-RED from Ross Cruickshank. Ross is a
	Developer Advocate at IBM working with the IBM Cloud platform and
	services. He is keen and active in recruiting into and maintaining the
	IBM and open source ecosystem.</p>
	<p>Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices,
	APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a
	browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the
	wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime
	in a single-click.</p>
