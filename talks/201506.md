	<h1>June 2015 Meet</h1>
	<p><b>Saturday 20th June, 1pm to 6pm at <a href="../venue.html">Broad Oak Social Club</a></b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">Short talk on and Demonstration of Trinity DE</b><b> - Lisi Reisz</b></p>
	<p>Lisi will show why she loves Trinity DE.</p>
	<p>When the much loved and lamented KDE3 was replaced by KDE4 Timothy Pearson, a Kubuntu developer, did not make the switch but
	continued to develop KDE3. Initially this venture was called Trinity-KDE, but the KDE developers objected to the use of the name
	KDE, so Trinity Desktop Environment was born.</p>
	<p>There is now a community and a small core of developers who have kept the desktop alive. Trinity's outstanding merit is its
	configurability. It is also light and very flexible. It can be all things to all men and is extremely accessible.</p>
