	<h1>February 2017 Meeet</h1>
	<p><b>Saturday 18th February, 1pm to 6pm at <a href="../venue.html">Broad Oak Social Club</a></b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">Southampton Robotic Sailing Project</b><b> - Dr. Thomas Kluyver</b></p>
	<p>Dr. Thomas Kluyver has kindly stepped in at short notice and will talk about the Southampton Robotic Sailing Project. He warns that
       	this will be a bit repetitive for anyone who went to the Southampton Python talk a few months ago.</p>
	<p>That said, and as somebody who attended the Southampton Python talk, I can recommend it and will gladly hear about it again. The
       	previous talk covered Raspberry Pis, Python, ROS (Robotic OS) and the challenges of working with wind, waves, tides and wireless data
       	gathering and control. <i>Paul Tansom (Ed).</i></p>
	<p>You can download the slides from the talk <a href="201702.odp">here</a>.</p>
	<p>And Tony's blog post about the visit <a href="http://blog.sotonsailrobot.org/articles/present-at-linux-user-group/">here</a>.</p>
