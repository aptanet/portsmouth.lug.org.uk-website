	<p><b>Saturday 21st July, 1pm to 6pm at <a href="../venue.html">Broad Oak Sports and Social Club</a></b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">ANTLR: Another Tool for Language Recognition</b></p>
	<p><b>Jeffrey Best</b></p>
	<p>Jeff will be talking about his experiences with ANTLR4, creating a small, domain-specific expression language
	for a Java application. There will be a real example, rather than a lot of theory on lexical analysis, grammars
	or parsing, but he will run through the basics of defining a lexer and a grammar, show the simple statements
	required to build a parse tree and the benefits of using listener methods, over visitors, to handle evaluation
	as ANTLR4 walks the parse tree. He will demonstrate adding ANTLR4 to your Java Maven project, how to generate
	the lexer and grammar source code from your definitions and how to extend the base listener class with your own
	implementations.</p>
