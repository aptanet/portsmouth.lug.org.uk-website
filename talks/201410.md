	<h1>October 2014 Meet</h1>
	<p><b>Saturday 18th October, 1pm to 6pm at <a href="../venue.html">Broad Oak Social Club</a></b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">Digital Photography - Command Line Tools for Photographers</b><b> - Dr. Adam Trickett</b></p>
	<p>Adam first describes cameras and what they can do, then what can be done with a cheaper camera that you thought could only be
	done with a more expensive one.<p>
	<p>Then he tells us of the many things that can be done at the command line when manipulating digital photographs; after having, of
	course, transferred the images from the camera to your computer.</p>
	<p>You can download the slides from the talk <a href="201410.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	<p>The slides as shown at the talk are followed immediately by annotated slides, so that you have what Adam said, not just the slides
	he showed.</p>
