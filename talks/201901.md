	<p><b class="blue">Load Balancing using the Linux Kernel</b></p>
	<p><b>Andrew Howe</b></p>
	<p>Andrew is a FLOSS enthusiast from Southampton, currently working as a Linux engineer at
	<a href="http://loadbalancer.org/">Loadbalancer.org</a> in Portsmouth.</p>
	<p>This talk will provide an overview of load balancing and how Linux is used to do it. While ‘application aware’ user-space load
	balancing software is all the rage these days, the Linux kernel contains a rock solid load balancing solution which is hard to beat
	in terms of raw performance. With a little knowledge, it's possible to build a Linux load balancer to meet the needs of even the busiest
	networks and environments.</p>
