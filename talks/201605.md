	<p><b class="blue">Installing Piwigo web gallery and Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates</b></p>
	<p>Paul Tansom runs <a href="https://www.aptanet.com/">Aptanet</a>, a local IT support company that specialises in Linux as
	well as supporting Windows, the occasional Mac and even comes across DOS once in a while still!</p>
	<br />
	<p>Using a practical demonstration Paul will work through the steps to install Piwigo web gallery software and obtain SSL
	certificates from the new Let's Encrypt service. The web server in use will be Apache running on Ubuntu, although this
	process should be easily transferable to other distributions.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.piwigo.org/">Piwigo</a> is open source photo gallery software for the web. It is written in PHP and uses
	<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a> as a back end database.</p>
	<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> is a free, automated, and open certificate authority brought to you by
	the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/isrg/">Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)</a> and is a
	<a href="http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation Collaborative Project</a>.</p>
