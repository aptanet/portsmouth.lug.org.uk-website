	<p><b>Saturday 20th July, 1pm to 6pm at <a href="../venue.html">Broad Oak Sports and Social Club</a></b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">WordPress - the hard way</b></p>
	<p><b>Paul Tansom</b></p>
	<p>WordPress has been around for a few years now, but it is sometimes easy to forget that it is an open source 
	project and you can install it on your own hardware. This talk will provide an overview of a manual install of 
	WordPress for anyone who either wants to try it or is interested in what is going on behind the scenes of hosting 
	providers one click installs.</p>
	<p>The talk will also cover the basics of getting up and running and touch on the new Gutenberg editor that is 
	intended to make creating content easier; whether this is the case will be left as an exercise for the audience!</p>
