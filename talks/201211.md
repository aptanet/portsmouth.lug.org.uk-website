	<h1>November 2012 Meet</h1>
	<p><b>Saturday 11th November, at Havant Library Learning Room 1</b></p>
	<p><b class="blue">DAD - Desktop Adapted for Dad</b><b> - Dr. Adam Trickett</b></p>
	<p>This was the first talk at our first “proper” meeting place after we reconvened in a pub. It was a small room at Havant Library,
	and was crowded with 11 of us. Dr. Adam Trickett kindly agreed to give us his talk on DAD - Desktop Adapted for Dad.<p>
	<p>Adam set up a computer for his elderly father some 200 miles away and designed it to make it easy for Dad to operate and Adam
	himself to administer.</p>
	<p>You can download the slides from the talk <a href="201211.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	<p>The slides as shown at the talk are followed immediately by annotated slides, so that you have what Adam said, not just the slides
	he showed.</p>
