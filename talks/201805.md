	<p><b class="blue">First steps with OpenWrt</b></p>
	<p><b>Paul Tansom</b></p>
	<p>OpenWrt is a Linux based operating system for embedded devices, particularly as a network router. There has 
	been some turmoil within the project in recent months, but with the merging of the LEDE fork things are looking 
	up. OpenWrt can remove the software limitations that are imposed on perfectly capable hardware by the stock 
	firmware.</p>
	<p>Having recently found the feature claims of the default firmware of some major brand routers to be somewhat 
	less than accurate, Paul has taken the plunge and installed OpenWrt. Flashing the firmware on your router can 
	be a daunting prospect, but it is actually more straight forward than it seems. This talk will cover choosing 
	the right hardware, installing OpenWrt, getting connected and explore what else can be done with the software.</p>
