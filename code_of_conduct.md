	<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
	<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meets or on our mailing list are required to agree with the following code of
	conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe
	environment for everybody.</p>
	<h3>The Quick Version</h3>
	<p>Our meets and mailing list are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender
	identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack
	thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
	appropriate for the venue or the list, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these
	rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meet or mailing list at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
	<h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
	<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
	physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
	stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
	and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
	<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
	<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or
	other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
	sexualised environment.</p>
	<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
	offender or expulsion from the meet or list.</p>
	<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organisers
	immediately.</p>
	<p>The organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise
	assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
	<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the meet venue and on the mailing list.</p>
