	<h1>Venue</h1>
	<h4><a href="http://www.broadoaksocialclub.net/where.php">Broad Oak Sports &amp; Social Club - Hilsea</a></h4>

	<p>Facilities for talks are good. We also have our own wi-fi over mobile broadband (thanks to
	<a href="http://wwww.wifirangeextender.co.uk">Airtime Networking</a> who donated the router). In addition to wi-fi, there are four
	ethernet ports for those that need a wired connection.</p>
	<p>There is a bar, which also serves tea and coffee. We supply some sandwiches, and the bar has a few crisps, chocolate bars etc..
	If you want anything more substantial by way of food you will need to bring it.</p>
	<h3>Getting there</h3>
	<p>There is plenty of parking just opposite the club, and Hilsea railway station is immediately adjacent. If coming by car, please
	note that Norway Road is at a higher level than Airport Service Road, and flies over it. There is a good bus service along Norway Road,
	and there is a bus-stop near to the steps down from Norway Road to Airport Service Road, adjacent to the Railway Station.</p>

	<h3>Parking</h3>
	<p>There is a car park opposite the venue that can be used. There is a barrier with a height restriction of 2.1m, but there is an
	industrial area just before the venue that is largely empty at weekends that some members have used (although we have not checked the
	parking restrictions). If the barrier is determinedly down in the extended part of the car park, and you need to get in, press the
	button for the intercom and say that you are visiting Broad Oak Social club. The barrier will then be raised.</p>
	<h3>Getting in</h3>
	<p>The door to the club may well be locked. If so, you will need to ring the buzzer and ask for the Linux meeting. Go up the stairs
	and through the bar to the door at the back left corner of the bar.</p>
	<p>The sign-in list will, as usual, be at the back of the room.  Please do not forget to sign it. The gold moneybox will also be at the
	back of the room, use of which is encouraged, but not compulsory.</p>
	<h3>Disabled Access</h3>
	<p>We like to consider ourselves as inclusive, but whilst we are very lucky to have a free to use venue that has good transport links, 
	there are stairs and no lift. This poses a barrier to wheelchair access. If you are interested in attending and this is preventing you
	please contact the '<a href="mailto:portsmouth-owner@mailman.lug.org.uk">lugmaster</a>'. We are always open to suggestions of
	alternative venues that may solve this problem.</p>
